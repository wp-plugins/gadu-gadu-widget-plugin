== Description ==

Gadu-Gadu (Polish for "chit-chat") is a Polish IM client.

The widget provides your Gadu-Gadu status (statusu) and allows people to add you to their list of contacts (kontakt).

I did a little searching and found the php calls needed to obtain a person's Gadu-Gadu status.  The best example was at the <a href="http://kacper.hostingposts.com/dev/im_status.html">Mirage Project</a>.

The script is UTF-8 compliant for handling Polish diacritics. 

The Gadu-Gadu widget is provided as-is.  There are no guarantees as to suitablity or workability.

The plugin is based on the Gadu-Gadu PHP script as found at the Mirage Project
